# EYT-xeditable

### Angular-xeditable

Angular-xeditable is a bundle of AngularJS directives that allows you to create editable elements.
Such technique is also known as click-to-edit or edit-in-place.

This module is useful for providing quick and easy editing interfaces that can facilitate a better field updating experience for small edits or corrections.

I can't really think of any cautionary warnings. You can find many, many examples of unique implementations with a quick google search.

To showcase the abilities of this module, I used the contact list demo from class. In my code you'll see I use xeditable in the Contact details view. So now, in the Contact details view, you can make and save changes to the contact without having to open up a whole new view or page.

Here's my example: http://students.washington.edu/nordale1/info343/challenges/EYT-xeditable/angular-forms/#/contacts
